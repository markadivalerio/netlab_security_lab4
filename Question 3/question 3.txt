Record all steps of this question using tcpdump (see question 2). 
1:Connect to the website http://www.baiwanzhan.com. 

2:Enter in the search bar any word.

3:Enter in the search bar the word 法轮.

4:Use python to split the GET request up so that the word 法轮 is split up
between two packets.

Examine the packets from steps 2 and 3.
- Open the pcap file with wireshark. 
- Find the packet containing the GET request using the magnifying glass icon to
  search for the benign word from step 2 above.
- Secondary mouse click on the GET request packet and select Follow->TCP stream.
- Observer the Time to Live (TTL) field in the packets sent from the server
  from steps 2 and 3 (you may have to clear the search in wireshark to find the
  packets associated with step 3).
